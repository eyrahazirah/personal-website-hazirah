<p>Hello, my readers. For this website, I will share my experience as a UiTM student.</p>

<p>My name is <font color="purple">Nur Hazirah Iwani</font> and I will share about my experience as a <font color="blue">UiTM</font> Student.</p>

<p>
<font color="brown">Everyone aspires to continue their education at a higher level. It's the same for me.</font>
<font color="red">This is because a person with a high education is highly respected by others.</font>
<font color="green">In addition, the knowledge learned can also be shared with many people because not many are fortunate enough to continue their studies at the University level.</font>
<font color="orange">Everything that happens can definitely be a sweet or bitter experience to be remembered until old age.</font> 
<font color="blue">Therefore, as a UiTM student, there are many sweet experiences that I can save as memories.</font>
</p>

</center>
<p>
<font color="purple">I am a person who has never been away from family members, since I was a UiTM student, I need to be independent because I need to be away from family members and live in a residential college provided by UiTM.</font>
<font color="blue">The residential college provided is very comfortable and many facilities can be used.</font>
<font color="red">The experience I remember the most was learning new subjects that I had never learned while in school. </font>
<font color="cyan">It was a bit hard for me to adjust but all that had to be changed to be a good student. </font>
<font color="green"> While in school I never knew what a national archive was, how to make a citation, how to edit a video and so on. </font>
<font color="orange">But since becoming a UiTM student, I have been introduced to such learning. </font>
</p>

<center>
<p>
<font color="brown">After studying those subjects from semester one to semester five, I became more proficient with what the lecturers had taught.  </font>
<font color="purple"> I am so thankful to have so many good lecturers and understand all the needs of the students. </font>
<font color="green">One of them is Madam Seri Intan.  </font>
<font color="red">Thank you</font><font color="blue"> for teaching me in this IMD311 subject so that I clearly understand how to create a personal website.</font>
